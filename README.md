# wsl-service-hyperv_not_installed-fix
- Fix for the wsl/service/createinstance/createvm/hcs/hcs_e_hyperv_not_installed error in WSL.

## Disclamers:
- I am not going to update this anymore.
- It might not work on your computer.
  - It will work on mine though.
- This is changed code that seemed to fix an error with Windows 11 Home.
  - The original code is from this [article](https://beebom.com/how-enable-hyper-v-windows-11-home/).
- It might work on a Windows virtual machine running WSL (why would you do that?).
